creata avar database in .env file and paste it there
add password and db name in the string
create connection.js for connecting db to mongoose
import mongoose and db
define connect()
now when we run we get that msg of db connected
next define collection or schema here, and for that create model file
inside schema created
we cn also make a schema js file here without any models
we ceated a model in productScehma.js based on what we have in collection
then dnt forget to export it

server paths are called routes where req come and resolve
create routes folder to hold all the api request
so we dnt create a index.js for giving all logic like in prev one 
hee v hav router.js
write all http req in there
logic v r defining in seperate logic file called productController.js

y we r creating these different files bcoz we are doing project in mvc model
m for model to keep data, view to see the data and c for controller to deifne logic to get the data in view

now in postman create a ecart and add new collection for get request
name the collection
provide the link for the request
